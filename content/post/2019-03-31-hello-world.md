  After so many years working in a totally different area, facilities management, other than programming, i am now starting a blog in Github. I was certified as Advanced Programmer 20 years ago (C language) and almost never used it afterwards, of course, those trainings and knowledge helps me a lot during my programming in PLC(Programmable Logic Controller, widely used in industries especially in petrochemical industry at 1990s in China).
  So, it looks like data technology as a nowadays' fashion or trend, makes me go back again to study/practice programming. I find it's still interesting for me, even let me get similar feelings as 20 years ago, this feeling is agreed and certified by my wife also.
  Old feelings in new voyoga, maybe this time I can touch something where no one has gone before..
